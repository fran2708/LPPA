                        <p>To meet global climate goals, wealthier nations must reduce their meat consumption by at
                            least 75 percent, researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany found in a new <a
                                href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-resource-111820-032340"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">study</a>. Slated to be published in October in the 14th
                            volume of the <em>Annual Review of Resource Economics</em>, the study—titled “Meat
                            Consumption and Sustainability”—examines the environmental costs of consuming animal
                            products at current rates. Researchers point out that half of the grain produced worldwide
                            is fed to animals who are then turned into food—a costly inefficiency when it comes to
                            resource usage. Animal agriculture is also a major contributor of methane, a powerful
                            greenhouse gas that accelerates global warming.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>Researchers explained that the average European Union citizen currently consumes 80 kilos
                            (176 pounds) of meat annually—and the average United States citizen consumes a whopping 124
                            kilos (270 pounds) of meat annually. Maintaining these levels of meat consumption is not
                            feasible for the growing world population, which is expected to reach more than 10 billion
                            by 2050.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>“If all humans consumed as much meat as Europeans or North Americans, we would certainly miss
                            the international climate targets and many ecosystems would collapse,” study author Matin
                            Qaim, a professor at the Center for Development Research (ZEF) at the University of Bonn,
                            said in a statement. “We therefore need to significantly reduce our meat consumption,
                            ideally to 20 kilograms or less annually. The war in Ukraine and the resulting shortages in
                            international markets for cereal grains also underline that less grain should be fed to
                            animals in order to support food security.”</p>

                        <p>The researchers’ recommendations mirror those previously suggested by other groups, including
                            <a href="https://vegnews.com/2020/3/greenpeace-calls-for-71-percent-drop-in-meat-consumption-in-europe-by-2030"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greenpeace</a> which urged the EU to slash meat
                            consumption and production by 71 percent by 2030 in order to mitigate the devastating impact
                            of animal agriculture on the climate crisis.</p>

                        <h2>Can taxing meat save the planet?&nbsp;</h2>

                        <p>One solution toward shifting consumption habits is imposing a tax on meat, a move that is
                            currently being considered by several countries. In 2020, the EU considered a <a
                                href="https://vegnews.com/2020/2/eu-considers-meat-tax-that-could-slash-beef-consumption-by-67-percent-by-2030"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">proposal</a> put together by Amsterdam-based True Animal
                            Protein Price (TAPP) Coalition to impose a “sustainability” tax on purchases of beef, pork,
                            and chicken.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>TAPP’s proposal was to include the hidden costs of animal agriculture—such as greenhouse gas
                            emissions, air and water pollution, and loss of wildlife—to set a fair price on meat based
                            on its climate impact. If adopted, TAPP suggests that this meat tax would lower beef
                            consumption in the EU by 67 percent, pork by 57 percent, and chicken by 30 percent by
                            2030—not the 75 percent recommended by the University of Bonn researchers but a good
                            start.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>“That’s certainly unpopular, especially since a 10- or 20-percent surcharge probably wouldn’t
                            be enough, if it’s supposed to have a steering effect,” Qaim said about implementing a meat
                            tax. “Meat, however, has a high environmental cost that is not reflected in current prices.
                            It would be entirely reasonable and fair to have consumers share more of these costs.”&nbsp;
                        </p>

                        <h2>Bridging the nutrition gap</h2>

                        <p>Despite their recommendation that meat consumption must fall by 75 percent to help meet
                            climate goals, the researchers warned that vegetarian diets are not ideal for everyone, in
                            particular poorer nations where people rely on animals as food and income sources. However,
                            since less developed countries consume meat infrequently, the researchers explained the onus
                            falls on wealthier countries to make sustainable dietary changes that will benefit the world
                            at large. “We need to become more sensitive to the global impact of our decisions,” Qaim
                            said.</p>

                        <p>One emerging sector that could offer a solution in bridging this gap is making plant-based
                            meat and dairy products using precision fermentation, a process that harnesses the power of
                            microbes to replace animals as the middlemen in protein production. The implications here
                            are vast for lower income countries as producing nutritionally dense foods in this way comes
                            with a great reduction in resource use, including eliminating the need for growing grain for
                            feed, when compared to animal agriculture.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>This protein independence is a stated goal of the largest company in the precision
                            fermentation space, <a href="https://vegnews.com/2021/10/perfect-day-cheese-label"
                                target="_blank" rel="noopener">Perfect Day</a>—which has raised $750 million to date to
                            decouple animals from the proteins they produce. Perfect Day makes its animal-free whey by
                            inserting cow DNA into microflora which then are instructed to protein milk proteins that
                            are identical to those made by animals. This technology presents myriad opportunities to
                            reduce human dependence on animals for food sources, particularly in nations with limited
                            resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

                            using precision fermentation. The company recently partnered with artisan macaron maker
                            Chantal Guillion to showcase its EggWhite technology in the company’s first-ever vegan
                            macarons. And while these are luxury goods, EVERY’s technology has similar implications for
                            nations with limited resources.&nbsp;</p>

                        <p>“One of the beautiful pieces of this [fermentation] technology is we can manufacture and brew
                            anywhere in the world and so every country can actually own their food supply so they’re not
                            dependent on foreign sources,” EVERY founder and CEO Arturo Elizondo told VegNews. “When
                            there are conflicts and there are pandemics, [this technology] can ensure that you can still
                            feed a population with high-quality protein.”</p>
