            <p>Google Maps denied <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2022/04/google-maps-stops-obscuring-russian-military-bases-in-satellite-images/">reports</a> Monday that it had made Russia’s strategic facilities visible to users, allegedly revealing details of the country’s military infrastructure.</p>
            <p>“We haven’t made any blurring changes to our satellite imagery in Russia,” Google spokesperson Genevieve Park said in an email <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/18/23030753/google-maps-russian-military-satellite-images-russia-ukraine">quoted</a> by U.S. media site The Verge.</p>
            <p>Images circulating online Monday of nuclear weapons stores, submarines, and military bases in Russia were likely genuine, but visible on Google Maps long before the conflict in Ukraine.</p>
            <p>The reports of Google removing the blurring were widely shared on social media.</p>
            <p>“Now everyone can see [Russian military infrastructure] with a resolution of about 0.5 meters per pixel,” <a href="https://twitter.com/ArmedForcesUkr/status/1516018161023389703?s=20&t=O1u4Nmu913bqULtiWI1Fzg">tweeted</a> an account linked to the Ukrainian armed forces.</p>
            <p>The incident came amid strained relations between Russia and U.S. tech giant Google.</p>
            <p>Google banned advertisements for Russian users following the Kremlin’s invasion of Ukraine, and Russian officials have accused Google-owned YouTube of stirring an “<a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2022/3/29/russia-draws-up-cases-against-google-for-not-removing-banned-info">information war</a>” after the video-hosting platform blocked Russian state media.</p>
            <p>Satellite images of military facilities are sometimes blurred by Google Maps, or displayed in lower quality, to protect their classified status.</p>
